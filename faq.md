Almost all the RPG Maker commands and features will be available. The current state of the engine doesn't give 100% of the features since the engine is still at its beginning.

## Can you upload in this app your own textures? <a href="#can-you-upload-in-this-app-your-own-textures" id="can-you-upload-in-this-app-your-own-textures"></a>

Yes, you can.

## What's the picture size & format support? <a href="#whats-the-picture-size-format-support" id="whats-the-picture-size-format-support"></a>

Max size: 4096x4096 pixels. Formats: .png, .jpg.

## What's the scale or game world size support in this game? <a href="#whats-the-scale-or-game-world-size-support-in-this-game" id="whats-the-scale-or-game-world-size-support-in-this-game"></a>

For now the max map size is 1000 x 1000 squares. But there will be a feature for connecting large maps to create really huge maps like open worlds.

RPG PAPER MAKER - how to have/make custom sprites. by Reptile
```

&#x20;So... Let we go to to `System menagement` (shortcut: 1) - and there we have `System` tab. On the very left, there is dialog options frame **MAP PROPERTIES** There you find `Square size (in px)`, this is where you say what is the size of your tiles (map elements). By default, it is 16x16 pixels. And as you take a look at the sample tileset, it goes like this

Every square of the tileset is 16x16. Your tileset file (PNG) it has to be made in similar way. 8 columns, and as rows as many as you wish. But here is the deal - if your tile in the map properties is set to example: `20` then remember, every element in the tileset it has to be 20x20 if you set 22, then 22x22 etc. **USUALLY!** Tilesets are 16x16, 20x20, 24x24, 48x48...

This is for tilesets, now let we talk about **CHARSETS** **CHARSETS** Again in the System management, System tab, below this **Map properties** there is another dialog box group option called **FRAMES** This is what you are interested in, if you want to change your characters frames etc.

[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860018638757429289/unknown.png?width=238\&height=300)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860018638757429289/unknown.png)

`Map frame duration` - this is the speed animation rate for our charset, you can change the numbers to see the result. Usually I do not touch this since I am ok with it. Default: 150 `Animation Frames` - this decides for **how much frames** your charsets (all charsets!) in the game will have. Default: 4 Default charsets in RPM are using 4 frames.

[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860019314332663808/bibi.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860019314332663808/bibi.png)

###

the animation it goes like: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4

Notice that frame 1 and 3 is the same.

Now if you wish to have MORE FRAMES of animation, you can insert there (in animation frames) `5` So the animation will be: 1-2-3-4-5 Charset while not moving - has frame #1 as idle.

###

> **CHARSET TEMPLATE**

The same rule as above for tilesets, user is deciding the size of the charset. It can be whatever you want. **BUT** there is one rule: EVERY FRAME it has to have the same size (width x height) As here in this template take a look:[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860020136688877568/template.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860020136688877568/template.png)

Every square frame in this charset template has size: 32x32 if you would like to have taller charsets - hey, no problem, just you have to make first square bigger (example: 32x100), if you make like this, then remember - EVERY SQUARE HAS TO HAVE THE SAME SIZE (32x100)

> **EXAMPLE OF MAKING MORE FRAMES**

So let we give more frames to our characters...

In `animation frames` I set "5", so every charset will have 5 frames.

My charsets look like this:

[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860021679338160138/testbox.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860021679338160138/testbox.png)

and this is also the animation, when it walks: it is 1-2-3-4-5 when it stands and wait, it is 1

[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860021840096788480/suichartest.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860021840096788480/suichartest.png)

[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860021842420039680/suichartest-2.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860021842420039680/suichartest-2.png)

of course this is just a test, as you can see I used a taller charset model (rip from suikoden) and I had change the last frame to standing green outfit. The animation is not good of course ![:wink:](https://discord.com/assets/2e41bfdeba797283ee9da9bb439c3ece.svg) but it works and you can use them for some tests.

> **BATTLERS**

[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860022660657446912/kate.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860022660657446912/kate.png)

`Battler frames` - how many frames the battler should have. Default: 4 `Battlers rows` - how many rows, animations poses the battler should have Default: 9 As for animation, and size - rules are the same as for charsets. Animation play like: 1-2-3-4 As it goes for `Battler rows`, battler animation poses, notice that some states require this option. Take a look at Datas manager, `Status` tab. There is `Death` and notice the option Battler possition is set to 8

[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860024174030094336/unknown.png?width=400\&height=232)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860024174030094336/unknown.png)

Why 8? Because take a look at the Kate.png battler - 8 is the last pose, and it is "death" or "KO"

> But in options there was 9, why 8?

Because I believe RPM is still in development, and battler poses it counts starting from "0"

> **BATTLER TEMPLATE**

[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565965228479610880/860024906897031168/template.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565965228479610880/860024906897031168/template.png)

Take a note, it is the same rule as charset when it goes to size, and animation. Default frames are 32x32 - you want bigger battlers? No problem, set your 1st frame bigger (example: 50x50), and then also the rest of the frames also have to be 50x50. You want to have more animation frames? Chenge the option `Battle frames`, and in the file make more frames. Simple as that. Now last note, Battler rows, as for now I do not see more options for it. I mean you can use it in `State` (Death/KO), later on once there will be other states (Sleep/Dizzy/Poison etc) I believe it will be handy to set your own pose for that state. Maybe it would be also cool to have a feature to set your own animation (battler position) for skills! ![:slight\_smile:](https://discord.com/assets/da3651e59d6006dfa5fa07ec3102d1f3.svg) But we will see.

\* \* \* @Darkand - there you go, hope those infos were bit helpfull.

To the others moderators ( @Wano ![:smile:](https://discord.com/assets/626aaed496ac12bbdb68a86b46871a1f.svg) ) if you think this tip/notes are ok/useful, you can copy them and post on site, or pin them on discord or something.

How would I make an entrance to a cave?

> **MadToastCrunch** How would I make an entrance to a cave?

&#x20;Draw a map, where you will see the entrance to the cave. On the entrance to the cave make a OBJECT (event) that looks like this: - no graphic - On the right you have **events** change that to `hero touch` - command: `Teleport object` - choose `Hero` - choose `CAVE MAP` - `Position select` and OK Done. Do not forget to make the same way EXIT from the cave.[![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/776751125629108224/860806836856946708/unknown.png?width=368\&height=300)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/776751125629108224/860806836856946708/unknown.png)

in my experience the teleport happens so fast that I add a small wait of around 0.4 after it, so the player doesn't accidentally walk back into the teleport if they are holding a movement direction. depending on where they end up on the other side\

Realized I made a tutorial about how I made rain in RPG paper maker, so I thought I'd share it! [https://saltedsporks.itch.io/our-pigmented-bonds/devlog/226687/entry-4-devlog](https://saltedsporks.itch.io/our-pigmented-bonds/devlog/226687/entry-4-devlog)\

KevinOfNine:



Using Weather

texture can be anything of course. it's actually possible to make it alternate between different texture by running another command with all the same values, but a different texture. however it needs to run in a loop for as long as it should be raining. you may want to use the wait and time feature, as needed. I made a test where it rains cats and dogs xD had to&#x20;

number of portions. simple, how many objects to have on the screen at one time, in one ray portion(explained below). dont make it too low, other wise you end up with big gaps(10 is too low for rain, imo).&#x20;

ray portion, is how much of the map gets the effect. or, how far out from the center it displays. when set to 1, it only rains on a small rectangle centered on the player. this is the default for rain. for snow it does 2 portions, therefore it draws snow further out from the player. you can kind of tell when it's swirling that it extend far out. I dont know the exact benefits of changing this, I suppose more gives depth but also would cause lag if too high. and you probably wouldnt see it all anyways&#x20;

size is the scale of the texture. you want to keep it small. but it depends, maybe you want it to rain down large rocks and lava from an erupting volcano.&#x20;

depthtest, this determines if it interacts with the map or if it shows the particles on top of everything. when ON, its a bit more laggy. I have a low end PC and when it's ON I get slight lag and if its OFF there is no lag. but when it's OFF, it looks TERRIBLE. when on, the particles will disappear when they touch part of your map&#x20;

depthwrite, not sure. probably a way of storing values of how far the textures are falling? probably not for the average user

Initial velocity - its default speed. negative values for falling. I suppose you could make bubbles and have them go up with a positive velocity, for an underwater map.&#x20;

velocity addition, better known as acceleration. by default this is a very very very small value with good reason. it will keep going and accelerate itself into a blur if allowed to go too high. if you adjust this, keep the numbers small initial&#x20;

y rotation. this determine how straight the textures fall. 0 is normal falling, like snow with 0 wind. as you increase it, it puts a spin on how it falls, like snow with some wind. although it appears to always move in a cyclone. again, use small values. 0.5 makes it rotate pretty hard&#x20;

y rotation addition, acceleration of this value. another one you want to keep very very small. I put something like 0.005 and it only took a few minutes for the slow cyclone to turn into a blur. probably not something to mess with, change the initial rotation and leave it be.
