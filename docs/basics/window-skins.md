# Window Skins

A WindowSkin is a picture that is cut for being used as a design for window boxes (text dialog for example), arrows (end of message, target selection, up/down), texts in battles (damage numbers with normal, critical, heals, and miss). RPG Paper Maker doesn't have a fix template, you can edit the cutting of each element of your WindowSkin by yourself.

Here is the default Window Skin image used:
