First of all, we strongly recommand you to use **Visual Studio Code** as your **IDE** \(**Integrated Development Environment**\). This will help a lot for auto-completion. You can download it here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Open it and go to `File > Open Folder` and select `YourProject/resources/app/Content/Datas/Scripts`
