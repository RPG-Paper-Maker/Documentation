# Variables overview

Variables are important to understand if you want to have a dynamic game. Here is an overview on the subject.

## What is a variable? <a id="what-is-a-variable"></a>

A variable is a value that can change when you are playing in your game. There are three possible type of variables:

* `Numbers`: number with or without decimals.
* `Switches`: ON or OFF.
* `Messages`: Any type of message.

You have access to a large number of variables. By default, when you launch a new game all the variables are equals to `0`.

## Variables manager <a id="variables-manager"></a>

Open the variables manager by clicking here on the main toolbar:

You can only manage the number and names of variables here. You cannot change the values. We will see later how to modify the values in-game.

## Using example <a id="using-example"></a>

Imagine that you want to create a feature that allows the player to change the music volume. You can use variables here! The engine propose to use fix numbers or variables:
