# Windows skins

## Window Skins <a id="window-skins"></a>

A WindowSkin is a picture that is cut for being used as a design for window boxes \(text dialog for example\), arrows \(end of message, target selection, up/down\), texts in battles \(damage numbers with normal, critical, heals, and miss\). RPG Paper Maker doesn't have a fix template, you can edit the cutting of each element of your WindowSkin by yourself.

Here is the default Window Skin image used:
